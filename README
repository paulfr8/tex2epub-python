This project aims at creating a Python script to convert Latex sources (especially Xelatex) into .epub ebooks.

Python Version:
python 3
(Python 3.3.1 more precisely)
I know that the code is not compatible with python 2.*, but it should be compatible with any version of python 3.

About the script so far:
I am a beginner at Python, so I have written simple functions, without classes and advanced features, as I have not found yet how I could use these features.

TODOÂ List:
Handle 2+ argument commands
Handle tables
Handle lists
Handle 0-argument commands (e.g. \hline)
Handle 1-argument commands splited over several lines
